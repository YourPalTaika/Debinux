# Debinux



Debinux is my personal Post setup script that automatically sets up the system with a Window Manager (i3) and some tools for content creation.
It is not super light or super heavy.
It has sub scripts to install proprietary Nvidia and AMD GPU drivers with the non-free repos enabled by default.
This script is meant to get the system going as fast as possible.
While you are free to use/edit/fork or whatever to this script, please note that this script was designed with my personal workflow in mind.
Any changes I makee to this script are made to suit my needs. If you dislike a portion of the script, fork it and change it. Power to you.

NOTICE: This should be run on a MINIMAL INSTALL, meaning you installed Vanilla Debian with the NetInst, and didnt select a DE or the Default Debian one.
