# Debinux



Debinux is a Post setup script that automatically sets up your system with a Window Manager (i3) and some tools for content creation.
It is not super light or super heavy.
It has sub scripts to install proprietary Nvidia and AMD GPU drivers with the non-free repos enabled by default. This script is meant to get you going
as easily as possible.

This script has been tested on real hardware as well as a Virtual Machine (Oracle VM Virtual Box).


NOTICE: This should be run on a MINIMAL INSTALL, meaning you installed Vanilla Debian with the NetInst, and didnt select a DE or the Default Debian one.
