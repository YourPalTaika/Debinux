# Debinux



Debinux is a Post setup script that automatically sets up your system with very minimal things. Should only be used as a BASE, user assembly acquired!!!


NOTICE: This should be run on a MINIMAL INSTALL, meaning you installed Vanilla Debian with the NetInst, and didnt select a DE or the Default Debian one.

ADDITIONAL NOTICE: This is a personal script for friends and myself. Its quality is not my priority
